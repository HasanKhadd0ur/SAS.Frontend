            <p>
              Social media has become a primary source of real-time information. 
              Our system leverages this by continuously scraping and analyzing 
              data from platforms like <strong>Telegram</strong> and 
              <strong>Twitter</strong> to identify events as they unfold.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              SAS leverages deep learning models, natural language processing, and

              geographic locations.

              SAS is designed for both the public and decision-makers. General users can

              event details.
