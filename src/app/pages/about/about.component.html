        <p>
          The <strong>Situational Awareness System (SAS)</strong> is a scalable,
          microservices-based platform designed to monitor and analyze daily and
          historical events on an interactive map. By combining social media data
          scraping, event detection, geolocation inference, and real-time
          visualization, SAS empowers decision-makers and individuals to stay
          informed and aware of unfolding situations.
